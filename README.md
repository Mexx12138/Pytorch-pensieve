# Pytorch-pensieve
a pytorch implementation of [pensieve](https://github.com/hongzimao/pensieve). The environment and system are based on the original version and the reinforcement learning algorithm is highly brought from [rl_a3c_pytorch](https://github.com/dgriff777/rl_a3c_pytorch).

## Requirements
#### Main Framework
* Ubuntu14.04

* Python2.7 & Python3.x

* [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/)

#### Python Packages
* selenium

* pyvirtualdisplay

#### Other Dependences
* apache2

* Google Chrome browser

## Data
Run `cd data` and follow the `Readme.md` in that folder.

## Training
Run `cd train` and follow the [Readme.md](https://github.com/shinshiner/Pytorch-pensieve/blob/master/train/Readme.md) in that folder.

## Testing
Run `cd test` and follow the [Readme.md](https://github.com/shinshiner/Pytorch-pensieve/blob/master/test/Readme.md) in that folder.

## Real Experiment
To run real experiment, you need to install the dependences in python2.7 first.
